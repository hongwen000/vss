# VSCode Window Launcher

Utilizing an intelligent search algorithm, the application will autocomplete your search query and find the most relevant VSCode window based on window title and user priorities.

## Features

- **Fast Title Matching**: Instantly provide relevant suggestions as you type, making it quicker to find the right window.
